        "Welcome! In this assignment you will be presented with two cases that require an AB test to choose an action to improve an existing product. You will perform AB test for a continuous and a proportion metric. For this you will define functions that estimate the relevant information out of the samples, compute the relevant statistic given each case and take a decision on whether to (or not) reject the null hypothesis.\n",
